Blackboards

Blackboards allows you to write and read C# application data with minimized class coupling.

Blackboards provides an interface and premade implementations of the blackboard software architecture pattern. Feel free to write a custom implementation with the same interface.

Premade implementations include:
1. Static blackboard
2. Instance blackboard
3. Unity PlayerPrefs blackboard
4. Local JSON text file blackboard 

Inspired by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas's description of the blackboard pattern in their book, The Pragmattic Programmer.
